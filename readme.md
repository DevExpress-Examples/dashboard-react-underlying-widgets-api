# Dashboard for React - How to access API of underlying widgets

The following example shows how to customize options of underlying widgets in the Dashboard Component for React.

Use the [ViewerApiExtension.on](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/js-DevExpress.Dashboard.ViewerApiExtension#js_devexpress_dashboard_viewerapiextension_on) and [ViewerApiExtension.off](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/js-DevExpress.Dashboard.ViewerApiExtension#js_devexpress_dashboard_viewerapiextension_off) methods to subscribe and unsubscribe from the events.

The Web Dashboard renders an underlying widget as follows:

1. The Web Dashboard loads the widgetâ€™s default configuration.

    The [onItemWidgetOptionsPrepared](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/js-DevExpress.Dashboard.ViewerApiExtensionOptions#js_devexpress_dashboard_viewerapiextensionoptions_onitemwidgetoptionsprepared) event is raised. Handle this event to customize the DevExtreme widgetâ€™s options before the widget is rendered.

1. The Web Dashboard renders the UI component with the configured options.

    The [onItemWidgetCreated](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/js-DevExpress.Dashboard.ViewerApiExtensionOptions#js_devexpress_dashboard_viewerapiextensionoptions_onitemwidgetcreated) event is raised. It occurs once for each UI component when the dashboard is loaded to the client. You can use this event to customize the UI component instance.

1. The UI component is updated (for example, when you apply filters or change parameter values).

    The [onItemWidgetUpdated](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/js-DevExpress.Dashboard.ViewerApiExtensionOptions#js_devexpress_dashboard_viewerapiextensionoptions_onitemwidgetupdated) event is raised. It occurs every time the UI component should be re-rendered. 
	

The customized options are listed below:

- The hovered grid row is highlighted in the underlying [dxDataGrid](https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/).
- A standard tooltip that appears when a user hovers over a chart's series point is disabled. 
- A custom tooltip appears when a user clicks a label on the chart's argument axis. The [onArgumentAxisClick](https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/#onArgumentAxisClick) property executes a function that invokes the custom tooltip.
- The [animation](https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/animation/) is enabled for the [dxChart](https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/) and [dxPieChart](https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPieChart/) UI components.
- The [dxPieChart](https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPieChart/) UI component displays a legend.
- The font weight and an interval between major ticks are modified in the [dxCircularGauge](https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxCircularGauge/) UI component.

The example uses a modular client-server approach. The server (backend) project communicates with the client (frontend) application that includes all the necessary styles, scripts and HTML templates. Note that the script version on the client must match the version of libraries on the server.

- The [asp-net-core-server](asp-net-core-server) folder contains an ASP.NET Core 6.0 Dashboard application.
- The [dashboard-react-app](dashboard-react-app) folder contains a client application.

## Quick Start

### Server

In the **asp-net-core-server** folder run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:5000` and the client gets data from `http://localhost:5000/api/dashboard`. To debug the server, run the **asp-net-core-server** application in Visual Studio and change the client's `endpoint` property according to the listening port: `https://localhost:44397/api/dashboard`.

See the following section for information on how to install NuGet packages from the DevExpress NuGet feed: [Install DevExpress Controls Using NuGet Packages](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/115912/installation/install-devexpress-controls-using-nuget-packages).

> This server allows CORS requests from _all_ origins with _any_ scheme (http or https). It is insecure, because any website can make cross-origin requests to the app. We recommend you specify the client application's URL directly to prohibit clients from getting access to your personal information on your server. Learn more: [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/400709)

### Client

In the **dashboard-react-app** folder, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Open ```http://localhost:3000/``` in your browser to see the result.
